Learning Swift
==============

This contains a handful of projects and playgrounds as I learn the basics of Swift.

The rm2kdev folder is the progression of my following the Swift tutorials by YouTube author rm2kdev.

The "My Task List" folder is my implementation of a basic task list app using Swift and other technologies as I learn them (MapKit, Core Data, CloudKit, etc).
